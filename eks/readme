Here are the high level steps.

1) Clone this repo: 

   git clone https://github.com/vanphan24/admin-partitions.git

2) Deploy 3 EKS clusters in your AWS envronments. You can go to the admin-partitions/eks/deploy-eks-clusters/ folder to automatically deploy using Terraform.

   Note: You'll need to have the follow resources available for the Terraform EKS deployment to work. 
    - You have terraform installed (https://www.terraform.io/downloads) 
    - An existing VPC
    - 3 public subnets, which are routeble to each other (they should already be by default)
    - If not already done, you have added labels as seen below to the each subnets. This allows Elastic LBs to be created by the EKS cluster.
       Key – kubernetes.io/role/elb
       Value – 1
    - You should create a Security Group that has open access for all-inbound and all-outbound access for any source and destination.
      This is for demo/testing purposes only, not production.  
    
3) Once the three EKS clusters are available, deploy consul by following readme steps in the admin-partitions/eks/Deploy-consul/1.11GA/ folder.
