This folder is used to deploy 3 eks clusters using terraform. Consul can then be deployed onto these EKS clusters.
- Consul Server cluster
- Consul Client 1 cluster
- Consul Client 2 cluster

Pre-reqs: The follow resources will be used as inputs to creating the EKS cluster.
  - You have terraform installed (https://www.terraform.io/downloads) 
  - You already have a VPC
  - You already have 3 public subnets, which are routeble to eachother (they should already be by default)
  - You have added labels as seen below to the each subnets. This allows Elastic LBs to be created by the EKS cluster.
     Key – kubernetes.io/role/elb
     Value – 1
  - You should create a Security Group that has open access for all-inbound and outboudn access for any source and destination.
    This is for the purposes only, not production.  

This has been depoyed using a mac and should also work on linux-like systems.
Copy or clone the whole repo to your local system.

# DEPLOY 3 EKS CLUSTERS
#######################

 1) In the admin-partitions/eks/deploy-eks-clusters/terraform/ directory, edit the variable.tf file to reflect your desired vpc, region, subnets, security group. 
    
    Note: It is recommended to not change the names of the EKS cluster because the scripts used to deploy Consul + Admin Partitions will 
    use these default names. Otherwise you'll need to edit to Consul install scripts as well to reflect your EKS cluster name.
    
 2) In the admin-partitions/eks/deploy-eks-clusters/terraform/ directory with the main.tf file, run: terraform init
 
 3) In the admin-partitions/eks/deploy-eks-clusters/terraform/ directory with the main.tf file, run: terraform apply

When complete, you should have 3 EKS clusters of which you can deploy Consul. 

To install Consul with Admin Partitions, go to the admin-partitions/tree/main/eks/Deploy-consul/1.11GA folder.
